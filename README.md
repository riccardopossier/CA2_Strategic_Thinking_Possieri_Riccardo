# E-Commerce Customer Churn Prediction


## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my capstone project on predicting customer churn in an e-commerce company. The project focuses on exploring the dataset, building predictive models, and addressing class imbalance to improve model performance.





## Key Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and relationships in the dataset.
Implementation of Logistic Regression and Random Forest models for predicting customer churn.
Handling of missing values, data preprocessing, and visualization techniques.
Evaluation of model performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Balancing the target variable using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).
